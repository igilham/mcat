# mcat - MPEG TS Concatenation

mcat is currently a simple proof of concept using [gots][gots] to read [MPEG transport stream][mpeg_ts] packets, and write them to an output.

This is only an early prototype for playing with the API surface at present and is not intended for any kind of production use.

## Build instructions

You need to have [Go][golang] installed and set up.

```shell
go get github.com/igilham/mcat
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/igilham/mcat
go build
```

##Â To do

I want to look into some of the following things to learn more about MPEG, the [gots][gots] API, and [Go][golang] in general.

- Buffered reader/writer implementation
- [Sync the reader to the packets](https://github.com/Comcast/gots/blob/master/cli/parsefile.go#L68)
- Explore options to correct the [programme clock reference (PCR)][pcr] while concatenating transport stream packets
- Explore options to drop [null packets][null_packet]
